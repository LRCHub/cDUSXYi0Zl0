He's just a stereotype
He drinks his age in pints
He has girls every night
He dosen't really exist

He spends his weekends with whatever floats
He forgets the punchline when he tells a joke
He wants to stay out dosen't want to go home
Till his prickly fingers are stuck down his throat

He's just a stereotype
He drinks his age in pints
He drives home pissed at night
And he listens to this every hour

He drank his fiancee when he...
The doctor said no drink for 17 weeks
He wants to gout but he has to stay home
So he watches color TV on his own

He's just a stereotype
He drinks his age in pints
He drives home pissed at night
And he listens to this every hour

The toplets are finished
The cure is complete
He hasn't had a drink for 17 weeks
17 punks to limit his night
Goes straight to his head, he ends up in a fight

He's chasing ... on a dark rainy night
The rest ... with flashing lights
His mom's waking up she hopes he's alright
But he's wrapped round the lampost on Saturday night

He's just a stereotype
He drinks his age in pints
He has girls every night
And he dosen't really exist
