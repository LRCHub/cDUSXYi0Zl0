Look out In the morning And you never see the sky You know it Already It is boring you to fly
I want more
All the time
Everyday
I say I wana get high again Never like that before I wanne get high again All I say I swear High, high I want to get high And a dry melon Can never drop a tear Spring is over And no refreshment near
