These fucking stereotypes

Hide your face with disdain
From collapse I will bring
With thebill of hate

Realize what I say
Just perception, rejection
For all they do sanction

They sanction that we only blow
There is just a line between us
The great depression, justice
Pay attention to me

I put myself into the danger
Yet I still just intend to fly
I never run from my intentions
And I still object all they do sanction

They sanction that we only blow
There is just a line between us
Remember you are the one to
Keep the distance with them

These fucking stereotypes
They fucking make me sick
They are just the brainwashed creatures
They only want to reign

Stereotype, selfish bitch!
